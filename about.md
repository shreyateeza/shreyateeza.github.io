### Hi! Glad you are here!  
  
I am ***Shreya Prasad***. I am a Senior Associate Software Engineer at Telstra in Bengaluru.
I pursued undergraduation from Netaji Subhas University of Technology, Delhi from Instrumentation and Control Engineering branch.



I recently developed a hobby of reading Self-Help books. So far, I have read "You Can Win" by Shiv Khera and "The Secret" by Rhonda Byrne. Currently, I have started reading "Think and Grow Rich" by Napolean Hill.

If you are a recruiter, you can also go through my Linkedin profile.
