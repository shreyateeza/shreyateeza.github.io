title: Inspiring Poems from You Can Win By Shiv Khera
---

1. **IF YOU THINK**  
If you think you are beaten, you are.  
If you think you dare not, you don't!  
If you like to win, but think you can't,  
It's almost a cinch you won't.  
you think you'll lose, you're lost;  
For out in the world we find  
Success begins with a fellow's will;  
It's all in the state of mind.  
If you think you are outclassed, you are,  
You've got to think high to rise,  
You've got to be sure of yourself before  
You can ever win a prize.  
Life's battles don't always go  
To the stronger and faster man,  
But sooner or later the man who wins  
Is the man who thinks he can.  
  
2. **DON'T QUIT**  
When things go wrong,  
As they sometimes will,  
When the road you're trudging seems all uphill,  
When the funds are low and the debts are high,  
And you want to smile, but you have to sigh,  
When care is pressing you down a bit  
Rest if you must, but don't you quit.  
Life is queer with its twists and turns,  
As every one of us sometimes learns,  
And many a failure turns about  
When he might have won had he stuck it out.  
Don't give up though the pace seems slow  
You may succeed with another blow.  
Success is failure turned inside out  
The silver tint of the clouds of doubt,  
And you never can tell how close you are,  
It may be near when it seems so far;  
So stick to the fight when you're hardest hit  
It's when things seem worst that you mustn't quit  
  
3. **RISKS**  
To laugh is to risk appearing the fool.  
To weep is to risk appearing sentimental.  
To reach outfox another is to risk involvement.  
To expose feelings is to risk exposing your true self.  
To place your ideas, your dreams, before a crowd is to risk their loss.  
To love is to risk not being loved in return.  
To live is to risk dying.  
To hope is to risk despair.  
To try is to risk failure.  
But risks must be taken, because the greatest  
hazard in life is to risk nothing.  
The person who risks nothing, does nothing, has  
nothing, and is nothing.  
They may avoid suffering and sorrow, but they  
cannot learn, feel, change, grow, love, or live.  
Chained by their attitudes, they are slaves,  
they have forfeited their freedom.  
Only a person who risks is free.  
  
4. **LUCK**  
He worked by day  
And toiled by night.  
He gave up play  
And some delight.  
Dry books he read,  
New things to learn.  
And forged ahead,  
Success to earn.  
He plodded on with  
Faith and pluck;  
And when he won,  
Men called it luck.
