## Letter to the Younger Me

Dear Younger Me,

I am writing you this letter to make you fully aware about your future. Be very attentive to it. The first and foremost thing is always be happy and stop thinking about the future. Do live in present. Make friends and have fun! Because you are not going to get this day again in your life. In short, “Work Hard, Play Hard”.
Also avoid procrastinating as it will create a lot of hurdles in your future. In addition to it, you should also work on your communication skills, as in future you have to interact with the world!
Think of your present as the only day you have and give your best to it then only you are going to shine in your future. And lastly remember-

“The Woods are lovely, dark and deep,
And miles to go before I sleep!”

With lots of love

Yours Truly
Older Wiser Self
